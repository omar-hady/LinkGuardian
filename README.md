## 📖 Usage

### Web Interface

Start the advanced web server:
```bash
python run.py web
```

Then open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

**Enhanced Web Features:**
- Real-time analysis with progress indicators
- Detailed security reports
- Interactive threat visualization

### Command Line Interface

#### Single URL Analysis
```bash
python run.py predict "https://example.com"
```

#### Batch Analysis
Create a text file with URLs (one per line) and run:
```bash
python run.py batch urls.txt
```

#### Direct CLI Usage
```bash
# Single URL with advanced analysis
python app/cli.py "https://example.com"

# Batch analysis with detailed reporting
python app/cli.py --batch urls.txt
```

## 🔧 Advanced Analysis Features

### Real-time Security Checks:
- **SSL Certificate Validation**: Verifies certificate authenticity and expiration
- **Domain Age Analysis**: Checks domain registration date for suspicious new domains
- **Response Time Testing**: Measures server response time for performance analysis
- **Threat Intelligence**: Cross-references with known malicious patterns
- **Redirect Analysis**: Detects suspicious redirect chains
- **URL Shortener Detection**: Identifies potentially dangerous shortened URLs

### Scoring Algorithm:
Uses multiple weighted factors:

**Critical Risk Factors (High Weight):**
- IP addresses instead of domains (0.4 points)
- @ symbols in URLs (0.35 points)
- Invalid SSL certificates (0.3 points)

**High Risk Factors:**
- Excessive subdomains (0.25 points)
- No HTTPS (0.25 points)
- Redirect keywords (0.2 points)
- URL shorteners (0.15 points)

**Medium Risk Factors:**
- Suspicious keywords (0.1 points)
- Hyphens/underscores in domains (0.1 points)
- Long URLs (0.1 points)

**Domain Analysis:**
- New domains (< 30 days: 0.2 points)
- Recent domains (< 90 days: 0.1 points)

### Scoring System:
- **0.0 - 0.1**: LEGIT (Safe) ✅
- **0.1 - 0.3**: SUSPICIOUS (Low Risk) ⚠️
- **0.3 - 0.5**: SUSPICIOUS (Medium Risk) ⚠️
- **0.5 - 0.7**: PHISHING (High Risk) 🚨
- **0.7 - 1.0**: PHISHING (Very High Risk) 🚨
